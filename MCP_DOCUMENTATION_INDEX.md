## 📊 Visual Aids

### Architecture Diagrams
Two interactive Mermaid diagrams have been generated:

1. **MCP Automated Quoting System Architecture**
   - Shows overall system flow
   - Customer → Backend → Pricing Engine → Decision Logic
   - Integration with Google Maps and databases

2. **Quote Calculation Flow**
   - Detailed pricing calculation steps
   - Distance → Zones → Time → Final Quote
   - Auto-approve vs manual review logic
