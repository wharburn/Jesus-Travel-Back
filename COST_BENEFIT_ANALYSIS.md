## 💵 Current Costs (Manual System)

### Time Analysis

**Assumptions:**
- Average quotes per day: 20
- Time per manual quote: 15 minutes
- Pricing team hourly rate: £25/hour
- Working days per month: 22

### Monthly Manual Quote Costs:
```
20 quotes/day × 22 days = 440 quotes/month
440 quotes × 15 minutes = 6,600 minutes = 110 hours
110 hours × £25/hour = £2,750/month
```

**Annual Cost: £33,000/year**

### Hidden Costs:
- ❌ Lost bookings due to slow response (estimated 10-15%)
- ❌ Customer frustration with wait times
- ❌ Pricing inconsistencies and errors
- ❌ No analytics or optimization insights
- ❌ Limited scalability (can't handle growth)

---

## 💰 Projected Savings with Automated System

### Direct Time Savings

**With 80% automation rate:**
```
440 quotes/month × 80% automated = 352 auto-quotes
352 quotes × 15 minutes saved = 5,280 minutes = 88 hours
88 hours × £25/hour = £2,200/month saved

Annual Savings: £26,400/year
```

**Remaining manual work:**
```
88 quotes/month requiring review × 5 minutes = 440 minutes = 7.3 hours
7.3 hours × £25/hour = £183/month
```

### Cost Comparison:

| System | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Current (Manual)** | £2,750 | £33,000 |
| **Automated** | £183 + £20 (API) = £203 | £2,436 |
| **SAVINGS** | **£2,547/month** | **£30,564/year** |
